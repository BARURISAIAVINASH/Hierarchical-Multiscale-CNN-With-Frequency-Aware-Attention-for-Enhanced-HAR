# Hierarchical-Multiscale-CNN-With-Frequency-Aware-Attention-for-Enhanced-HAR
HAR accuracy improves with deep CNNs but often at the cost of higher computation, requiring lightweight and efficient models for resource-limited devices.  We propose HMCN-FBAM, combining multiscale CNN feature extraction and frequency-based attention on transformed activity images for efficient recognition.
